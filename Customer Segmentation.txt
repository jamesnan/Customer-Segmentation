10. Customer Segmentation in Python
 

The customer segmentation dataset on Kaggle is a great way to get started with unsupervised machine learning. This dataset consists of customer details like their age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

You need to use these variables to build customer segments. Customers who are alike should be grouped into similar clusters. You can use algorithms like K-Means clustering or hierarchical clustering for this task. Customer segmentation models can provide business value.

Companies often want to segregate their customers to come up with different marketing techniques for each customer type.

The main goals of this dataset include:

Achieving customer segmentation using machine learning techniques
Identify your target customers for different marketing strategies
Understand how marketing strategies work in the real world
Building a clustering model for this task can help your portfolio stand out, and segmentation is a great skill to have if you are looking to get an AI-related job in the marketing industry.

9. Customer segmentation
The businesses are always looking for a method to segment their customers so that customer-specific strategies and product placement could be made that best suits their requirements. If you are the person who has a Data Science Project on Customer Segmentation than you will certainly gain a cutting edge advantage over other candidates. Customer segmentation is also considered as unsupervised learning in which the use of clusters is made by the company to define and place its customers in different sections based on age, region, gender, interest, habits, preferences, etc. You can use K-means clustering and thereby visualize the age, gender and other bases of distribution of customers for segmentation purposes. You can utilize the inputs of annual incomes, preferences and spending scores made by them during a particular period.

9. Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is one of the most significant unsupervised learning processes and one of the simplest Data Science projects for beginners. Companies use the clustering process to track similar categories of individuals. This is done in order to target the potential user base. When you work on the project, you become well-versed in K-means clustering. Clustering with K-means is a top strategy for unsupervised data.

Companies learn more about their consumers and their requirements through customer segmentation. Data are very significant here, linked to the population, the state of the economy, the geography and actions.

What is Customer Segmentation?
The process of dividing a company’s customers into different groups (each group reflects similarity), is known as customer segmentation. The goal is to decide how we can relate the customers in each segment to maximize the value of the customers to the business.

Typically, customers are divided into segments based on the following factors:
psychographic, demographic, geographic segmentation, behavioral. However, there are other ways to divide the customer group as well. The reason company’s perform customer segmentation is because they realize that each customer group may have different needs. To satisfy the various requirements of different groups, a company must cater to their needs differently.

Details about the project
Businesses are always in the process of devising methods to segment their customers. The segmentation process ensures that the business can create consumer-specific strategies and create a product or service that suits their needs. This is a MUST-DO activity before running any online marketing campaign. 

Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. In this, clusters are used by the company to define and place its customers in different groups which are categorized on the basis of region, gender, age, preferences, and so on. This project is also useful to identify the inputs of annual incomes and spending trends of the customers to create a strategy for that segmen
